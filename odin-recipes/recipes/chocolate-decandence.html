    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This dessert is pure decadence. The flourless chocolate decadence cake was all the rage in the 1980s.<br> As I vaguely remember, the decade celebrated decadent overindulgence, and this dessert is that — and more.<br> By modern standards, this cake is ridiculously rich.<br> In fact, some of you may find it too intense, but most true chocolate lovers will be in heaven.<br> Serve with ice-cold fresh raspberry sauce.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>18 ounces semisweet chocolate, chopped</li>
        <li>10 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>5 large eggs, at room temperature </li>
        <li>4 teaspoons white sugar</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Butter and flour a 9-inch cake<br> pan. </li>
        <li>Melt semisweet chocolate and unsalted butter together in the top of a double boiler<br> over simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula, until chocolate and butter<br> are completely melted and combined. Remove from the heat. </li>
        <li>Beat eggs and sugar together in a bowl with a whisk or electric mixer until pale and very<br> thick, 5 to 10 minutes. Sift in flour, cayenne, and salt; whisk<br> to combine. </li>
        <li>Pour 1/4 of the egg mixture into the chocolate mixture; stir to combine. Pour chocolate<br> mixture into remaining egg mixture and stir until combined.<br> Pour batter into the prepared pan. </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until just barely set, with a jiggle below the surface, 14<br> to 15 minutes. Cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes.<br> Wrap in aluminum foil and refrigerate until chilled, at least 1 hour. </li>
    </ol>
